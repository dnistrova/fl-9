				<h2>The dark side of the moon is a myth.</h2>
			</a>
			<p>In reality both sides of the Moon see the same amount of 
			sunlight however only one face of the Moon is ever seen from 
			Earth. This is because the Moon rotates around on its own axis
			in exactly the same time it takes to orbit the Earth, meaning 
			the same side is always facing the Earth. The side facing away
			from Earth has only been seen by the human eye from spacecraft.</p>

				<h2>The rise and fall of the tides on Earth is caused by the Moon.</h2>
			</a>
			<p>There are two bulges in the Earth due to the gravitational 
			pull that the Moon exerts; one on the side facing the Moon, and 
			the other on the opposite side that faces away from the Moon. 
			The bulges move around the oceans as the Earth rotates, causing 
			high and low tides around the globe.</p>

				<h2>The Moon is drifting away from the Earth.</h2>
			</a>
			<p>The Moon is moving approximately 3.8 cm away from our planet 
			every year. It is estimated that it will continue to do so for 
			around 50 billion years. By the time that happens, the Moon will 
			be taking around 47 days to orbit the Earth instead of the current
			27.3 days.</p>

				<h2>A person would weigh much less on the Moon.</h2>
			</a>
			<p>The Moon has much weaker gravity than Earth, due to its 
			smaller mass, so you would weigh about one sixth (16.5%) of 
			your weight on Earth. This is why the lunar astronauts could 
			leap and bound so high in the air.</p>

				<h2>The Moon has only been walked on by 12 people; all American males.</h2>
			</a>
			<p>The first man to set foot on the Moon in 1969 was Neil Armstrong 
			on the Apollo 11 mission, while the last man to walk on the Moon in 
			1972 was Gene Cernan on the Apollo 17 mission. Since then the Moon 
			has only be visited by unmanned vehicles.</p>

				<h2>The Moon has no atmosphere.</h2>
			</a>
			<p>This means that the surface of the Moon is unprotected from cosmic 
			rays, meteorites and solar winds, and has huge temperature variations.
			The lack of atmosphere means no sound can be heard on the Moon, and 
			the sky always appears black.</p>

				<h2>The Moon has quakes.</h2>
			</a>
			<p>These are caused by the gravitational pull of the Earth. Lunar 
			astronauts used seismographs on their visits to the Moon, and found 
			that small moonquakes occurred several kilometres beneath the surface, 
			causing ruptures and cracks. Scientists think the Moon has a molten 
			core, just like Earth.</p>

			passed within 5995 km of the surface of the Moon before going into 
			orbit around the Sun.</p>

			all goes according to plan.</p>
